This data set is a collection of video game names, prices and the reviews that it received. For this data set, I had two theories;
that the Pice was correlated with Game Length and that Game Reivews also contributedto the Price.  

After importing the relevant data frames (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) the next step is cleaning and aggregating the data.
For cleaning the data duplicates were droped, NA values were identified and also droped and finally, the unique values were identifed in each column.
Then aggregating the data so that creating visual depictions would be easier. 

Next, visualizing the data, I chose to go with a scatter plot and a histogram, the scatter plot can easily create a visual representation of the thousands rows of data.
The histogram was used to demonstrate how many games require multi-player and how many are solo adventures. 

Overall, the data would lead me to conlcuse that there is very little correlation between the Price of Video Games and the Length. However, there is a strong correlation 
between Price and User Rating.
